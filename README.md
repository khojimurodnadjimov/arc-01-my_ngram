# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
In fact, I did not have any problems with this assignment. Because this issue is the first, in my opinion, it was made very easy. But I thought a bit about how to validate characters and it was difficult to do in C until I learned to use an ASCI table.


## Description
How have you solved the problem?
By using the ASCII table I compared the characters to each other and the ASCII table helped me solve my problem. This is not only the only solution for everyone who wants to solve this problem


## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
You can use the "make" file to run this program


## Usage
How does it work? But they won't flower like they did last spring
in my program I used a "for" loop to find how many times each character is repeated. During the development of this program, I got a lot of benefits from the ASCII table and learned about its many features. I wrote my functions in a separate file in this 
program and found that it made the programming process very easy! I also wrote a Makefile that allows me to run all the files for all my projects at once!
