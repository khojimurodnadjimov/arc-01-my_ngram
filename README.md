# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
Mainly the trouble I had was creating the makefile and saving the enumerable characters!


## Description
How have you solved the problem?
I was wondering how to store the chars as many times as they came! 
But I found out that it is very easy! I put them in an array of 128 characters! 
Makephilham isn't as hard as I thought!


## Installation
How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
I used the standard libraries <stdio.h> , <string.h> and created my first library "mylib.h"!


## Usage
How does it work?But they won't flower like they did last spring
In my program i used a "for" loop to find how many times each character is repeated. During the development of this program, I got a lot of benefits from the ASCII table and learned about its many features. I wrote my functions in a separate file in this 
program and found that it made the programming process very easy! I also wrote a Makefile that allows me to 
run all the files for all my projects at once!



```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
